This program's original purpose was to attempt to solve the California Zodiac Killer's unsolved 340-length cipher from November 9, 1969.

The program has since been advanced to being able to solve general-case homophonic and monophonic ciphers.  It should now be considered an open-source workbench for use in solving general classical-crypto style ciphers.
