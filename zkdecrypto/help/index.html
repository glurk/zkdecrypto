program<br>2. &nbsp;Select File&gt;Open Cipher (Alternatively Ctrl+O)<br>3. &nbsp;Browse to the ascii file that contains the cipher, click on the file, and then click the "Open" button<br>4. &nbsp;Select Key&gt;Init Key (Alternatively Ctrl+I) and select "OK" (this will give you a standard frequency key).<br>5. &nbsp;Now you can select the "start" button and the main window<br>6. &nbsp;The program will run until it finds what it considers an optimal solution<br>7. &nbsp;The Start/Stop buttons do precisely what they say<br>8. &nbsp;The reset button internally resets the solver back to the beginning<br>______________________________________________________________________<br><a name="howtoadd"></a><br><b>2.&nbsp;How to add extra characters to the key</b><br><img src="images/Image35.jpg" /><br>1. &nbsp;Select Solve&gt;Options<br>2. &nbsp;You should see a text box labeled "Additional Key Letters"<br>3. &nbsp;Add any extra characters that you want the solver to consider to this text box<br>4. &nbsp;Uncommon characters make great "Additional Key Letters"<br>5. &nbsp;Click "OK", the new settings take effect immediately<br>______________________________________________________________________<br><a name="howtoeditcipher"></a><br><b>3.&nbsp;How to edit the cipher</b><br><img src="images/editcipher.jpg" /><br>1. &nbsp;Select Edit&gt;Edit Cipher<br>2. &nbsp;A basic text editor will open up containing your cipher, do not worry about spacing, the program automatically<br>removes extra spaces.<br>3. &nbsp;Make desired changes to cipher<br>4. &nbsp;Click File&gt;Save<br>______________________________________________________________________<br><a name="howtosavekey"></a><br><b>4.&nbsp;How to save the current best key</b><br><img src="images/savekey.jpg" /><br>1. &nbsp;Select File&gt;Save Key (Alternatively Ctrl+S)<br>2. &nbsp;Browse to the desired save directory<br>3. &nbsp;Give your key file an appropriate name and click save<br>______________________________________________________________________<br><a name="howtoopenkey"></a><br><b>5.&nbsp;How to open a saved key</b><br><img src="images/openkey.jpg" /><br>1. &nbsp;Select File&gt;Open Key<br>2. &nbsp;Browse to the directory that contains the key file<br>3. &nbsp;Click the file and click the "Open" button<br>4. &nbsp;This essentially gives the program the state as when you saved the file<br>______________________________________________________________________<br><a name="howtosavetext"></a><br><b>6.&nbsp;How to save the plain text</b><br><img src="images/saveplain.jpg" /><br>1. &nbsp;Select&gt;Save Plain Text<br>2. &nbsp;Browse to the desired save directory<br>3. &nbsp;Give your key file an appropriate name and click save<br>4. &nbsp;If you are interested in preserving the current solution, you may want to save the key along side with the plain text<br>______________________________________________________________________<br><a name="switchlanguage"></a><br><b>7.&nbsp;How to switch the solving language</b><br><img src="images/Image37.jpg" /><br>1. &nbsp;Select Solve&gt;Options<br>2. &nbsp;In the "Misc Options" section you should see a drop down list labeled "Language"<br>3. &nbsp;Select your desired language and click "OK"<br>4. &nbsp;The settings take effect immediately<br>______________________________________________________________________<br><a name="changepriority"></a><br><b>8.&nbsp;How to change the system resources the program uses (How much it slows your system)</b><br><img src="images/Image35.jpg" /><br>1. &nbsp;Select Solve&gt;Thread Priority<br>2. &nbsp;You should see a list of priorities, High being the most system intensive, idle being the least intensive<br>3. &nbsp;Select your desired priority and a check-mark should appear next to it<br>______________________________________________________________________<br><a name="lock"></a><br><b>9.&nbsp;How to lock a character to a symbol (and unlock)</b><br><img src="images/locksymbol.jpg" /><br>1. &nbsp;A character-symbol combination will lock by double clicking (Alternatively by selecting and Ctrl+L)<br>2. &nbsp;Square brackets will appear around a locked symbol<br>3. &nbsp;You can also lock a character-symbol combination by highlighting it and select Key&gt;Lock Symbol<br>4. &nbsp;You can unlock by double clicking or repeating step 3 and selecting Key&gt;Unlock Symbol (Alternatively by selecting and Ctrl+U)<br>5. &nbsp;You can lock and unlock all symbols by select Key&gt;Lock All or Unlock All<br>______________________________________________________________________<br><a name="merge"></a><br><b>10.&nbsp;How to merge symbols and simplify the cipher<br></b>If you suspect that two symbols represent the same plain-text character, it is beneficial to the solver to merge those characters<br>together. &nbsp;In general, the fewer the symbols the easier it is to solve (if its homophonic). &nbsp;The downfall may be that the merging of <br>symbols destroys the natural expected frequencies between plain characters and cipher characters.<br>To use this feature:<br>1. &nbsp;Select Cipher&gt;Merge Symbols (Alternatively Ctrl+M)<br><img src="images/Image20.jpg" /><br>2. &nbsp;Select the two symbols you would like to merge in each of the drop downs<br>3. &nbsp;Click "OK" and the symbols will be automatically merge<br>If you would like the program decide which symbols are the best to merge you can use the simplify feature.<br>To use this feature:<br>1. &nbsp;Select Cipher&gt;Simplify<br><img src="images/simplify1.jpg" /><br>2. &nbsp;It may take 30 or more seconds, but once the program determines which symbols to merge, it will report them to you and<br>give you the option to merge them.<br>______________________________________________________________________<br><br><a name="wordplug"></a><b>11.&nbsp;Using the word-plug feature</b><br>The word-plug feature takes a word as input and attempts to place that word in an optimal location within the cipher.<br>It automatically adjusts the key when it places the word and locks those character-symbol combinations. &nbsp;This is a more<br>advanced feature that takes practice using. &nbsp;It is good to test it out on practice ciphers. &nbsp;Just because it places a word, it doesn't<br>mean that the word it in the actual correct solution.<br>To use the feature:<br><img src="images/wordplug.jpg" /><br>1. &nbsp;Select Solve&gt;Wordplug (Alternatively Ctrl+W)<br>2. &nbsp;Type in the word that you want the word-plugger to place<br>3. &nbsp;Click "OK" and it will automatically be placed<br>______________________________________________________________________<br><br><a name="exclude"></a><b>12.&nbsp;Excluding letters from symbols</b><br>Excluding letters allows you to prevent a symbol from taking on a certain letter.  This feature is usefull for controlling the behavior of symbols.<br>To use the feature:<br>1. &nbsp;Right click the desired symbol in the key area and select "Exclude Letters" (Alternatively Shift+Ctrl+X)<br><img src="images/exclude1.jpg" /><br>2. &nbsp;Type in all of the letters that you would like to be excluded from that symbol<br><img src="images/exclude2.jpg" /><br>3. &nbsp;Click "OK" and your changes will take effect<br>______________________________________________________________________<br><br><a name="failure"></a><b>13.&nbsp;Changing the maximum allowable failure</b><br>This will allow the program more time to work its way out of local maxima when attempting to solve a cipher.<br>To use the feature:<br>1. &nbsp;Select Solve&gt;Options<br><img src="images/failure1.jpg" /><br>2. &nbsp;Change the value located in the "Max Failures" textbox to your desired value<br><img src="images/failure2.jpg" /><br>3. &nbsp;Click "OK" and your changes will take effect (you should notice the failure number is updated on the "Solve" tab)<br>______________________________________________________________________<br><br><a name="swaps"></a><b>14.&nbsp;Changing the number of random swaps on a key after a failure</b><br>This will also help the program more time to work its way out of local maxima when attempting to solve a cipher.<br>To use the feature:<br>1. &nbsp;Select Solve&gt;Options<br><img src="images/swaps1.jpg" /><br>2. &nbsp;Change the value located in the "Random Swaps" textbox to your desired value<br>3. &nbsp;Click "OK" and your changes will take effect<br>______________________________________________________________________<br><br><a name="revert"></a><b>15.&nbsp;Changing the revert period</b><br>The revert period is how many iterations to perform before reverting back to the previous best key which is also important<br />to getting unstuck from local maxima.<br>To use the feature:<br>1. &nbsp;Select Solve&gt;Options<br><img src="images/revert1.jpg" /><br>2. &nbsp;Change the value located in the "Revert Period" textbox to your desired value<br>3. &nbsp;Click "OK" and your changes will take effect<br>______________________________________________________________________<br><br><a name="transposition"></a><b>16.&nbsp;Transposing the cipher text</b><br><img src="images/transpose1.jpg" /><br>1. &nbsp;Select Cipher and "Flip Horizontal" or "Flip Vertical" or "Reverse"<br>2. &nbsp;Your change should take effect immediately<br>______________________________________________________________________<br><br><a name="poly"></a><b>17.&nbsp;Performing polyalphabetic analysis (Vignere ect...)</b><br>This feature is useful for analysing polyalphabetic ciphers.  This feature generates a graph with key length on the x-axis and index<br>of coincidence on the y-axis.  Vignere ciphers tend to have a peak index of coincidence on the correct key length.<br>To use the feature:<br><img src="images/polyalph1.jpg" /><br>1. &nbsp;Select Cipher&gt;Polyalphabet Analysis<br>2. &nbsp;Put in a max key length and select "OK"<br><img src="images/polyalph2.jpg" /><br>3. &nbsp;You should now see a graph<br><br><br><br></div></BODY></HTML>
